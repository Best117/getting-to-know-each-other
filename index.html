        <h1>My Favorite Hobby / Activity</h1>
        <p>My favorite hobby is playing video games. I have been playing video games since I was very young, younger than I can really remember. My favorite video games series is Halo. My first Halo game was Halo 2 and I played it at my cousins house when I was around 5 years old.</p>
        <h1>Fun Fact</h1>
        <p>A fun fact about me is that I have built multiple computers since my freshman year of high school. These builds are gaming oriented. So things like big CPU coolers, big graphics cards, and lots of storage for games are all included in these computers. I find it very fun to put them together.</p>
